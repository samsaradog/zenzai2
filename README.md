# Welcome to the Triple World

This site is meant to support activities of the Lexington Nichiren Buddhist Community by automailing the Daily Dharma email.
It is built with Bootstrap and Datatables. Gracious thanks to Sophia Bell and her [post](https://blog.makersacademy.com/how-to-install-bootstrap-and-jquery-on-rails-6-da6e810c1b87) on getting these to work in Rails 6.
